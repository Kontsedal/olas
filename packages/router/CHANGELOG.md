### Minor Changes

- ba0b9cb: Remediation correctness pass — a full-repo deep audit (five independent review passes, worst findings pinned with probe tests) fixed across core + every satellite. Released as a **minor** bump under the 0.x convention to signal the documented behavior changes (listed at the end).

  Highlights:

  - **Query cache:** hydration is namespaced by query identity (no cross-query data theft); plugin/remote `setData` no longer leaks snapshots or wedges `hasPendingMutations`; out-of-order optimistic rollback fixed; `refetchInterval` no longer livelocks when a fetch outlasts the interval; infinite-query status no longer wedges at `'pending'`; new `query.cancel(...)` / `cancelAll`; `networkMode: 'offlineFirst'` implemented + `AsyncState.isPaused`; `stableHash` Date/class handling fixed.
  - **Lifecycle:** a key change while suspended no longer bricks the subscription; every `ctx.*` factory throws consistently after dispose; `ctx.collection` reconcile no longer tracks user-code reads; explicit item suspension survives a tree suspend/resume; `debounced`/`throttled` gain `dispose()`.
  - **React:** `HydrationBoundary` owns its root (no StrictMode leak / no unmount leak); `Mutation.status` drives `useMutation`'s `isSuccess`/`isIdle`/`isError` (fixes `void` mutations reading idle forever); `useSuspenseQuery` keeps stale data on a background-refetch failure; `use(signal, { select })` re-derives when the selector changes; KeepAlive is refcounted.
  - **Forms:** structural `FieldArray` edits mark `isDirty` (a background refetch no longer deletes rows the user just added); form-/array-level validators can target specific fields by returning `FormIssue[]`, and the Standard-Schema adapter preserves each issue's `path`; `required(false)` now passes and a new `mustBeTrue` covers consent checkboxes; `isValid` holds its last settled value while validating (no submit-button strobe).
  - **Satellites:** persist gained IndexedDB commit-ack + honest error routing and now-tested `version`/`migrate`/`throttleMs`/`onError`; mutation-queue gained reconnect replay, cross-tab replay coordination (Web Locks + lease), and `onReplaySettle` cache reconciliation (and is honestly labelled "best-effort"); devtools fixed the false-`[Circular]` render + unbounded tree growth; cross-tab dropped the dead `crossTab: 'infinite'|'both'` values and filters on receive; zod fixed an async abort-race and warns on duplicate-copy schemas; router seeds SSR route state and widened `params`; realtime reports `'unknown'` connection state instead of lying `'connected'`.

  Full detail: `.wiki/log.md` (phase 0–6 ingests) + the per-package CHANGELOGs.

  **Behavior changes to note:** `required(false)` now accepts a boolean; `crossTab` no longer accepts `'infinite'` / `'both'`; form-level validators may return `FormIssue[]`; a field's `isValid` no longer flips `false` purely because a validation is in flight; realtime `ConnectionState` gains `'unknown'`; calling any `ctx.*` factory after dispose now throws.

## 0.0.7 – 0.0.15

> Versions bumped in lockstep across the workspace but **never published** — npm stayed at `0.0.6` (2026-05-21). Summaries reconstructed from `git log`; the next published release (see the pending changeset) rolls these up together with the remediation correctness pass.

- **0.0.15** — streaming SSR phase 2 (client batching + Web `TransformStream`)
- **0.0.14** — streaming SSR foundation (phase 1)
- **0.0.13** — key-hash hardening, form `clearSubtree`, SSR `HydrationBoundary` (batch 6)
- **0.0.12** — O(1) lifecycle teardown + `ctx` reactive primitives + mutation-queue size guard (batch 5)
- **0.0.11** — signal/controller DX + realtime/collection ergonomics (batch 4)
- **0.0.10** — ergonomic completions, devtools coalescing, mutation-queue hardening (batch 3)
- **0.0.9** — ergonomic completions + plugin upgrades (review batch 2)
- **0.0.8** — correctness pass + ergonomic upgrades (review findings)
- **0.0.7** — correctness pass on `lazyChild`, forms, mutation-queue, keep-alive

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Phase 0.2b — Router adapter package + `RootOptions.scopes` for cross-cutting scope seeding.

  Treated as patch under the 0.x.y line — purely additive across the existing nine packages, plus one new opt-in package.

  **Core — `RootOptions.scopes`**

  - New `scopes?: ReadonlyArray<[Scope<unknown>, unknown]>` option on `createRoot`. Pre-seeds scopes on the root controller instance BEFORE its factory runs so `ctx.inject(...)` resolves them from any descendant. Useful for adapters that want to publish cross-cutting values without forcing the user's root controller to call `ctx.provide(...)`. Later bindings for the same scope override earlier ones.

  **New package: `@kontsedal/olas-router`**

  A generic, router-agnostic adapter for wiring any client-side router (TanStack Router, React Router v6, or your own) into the olas controller tree via three scopes:

  - `RouteParamsScope: Scope<ReadSignal<Record<string, string>>>`
  - `RouteSearchScope: Scope<ReadSignal<Record<string, unknown>>>`
  - `RoutePathnameScope: Scope<ReadSignal<string>>`

  `createRouterAdapter()` returns `{ scopes, Bridge }`. `scopes` plugs into `createRoot({ scopes: adapter.scopes })`; `<adapter.Bridge params={...} search={...} pathname={...}>` mounts inside the React tree and pushes router state into the underlying signals on every change.

  Each `createRouterAdapter()` call mints its own signal store, so per-request SSR roots and isolated test fixtures don't share state. Shallow-equals incoming `params` / `search` records to avoid spurious writes when the router allocates fresh object literals on every render.

  **Next.js is not supported** — see `BACKLOG.md` for the philosophy reasoning.

  **Recipes**

  - `RECIPES.md` Router-integration section rewritten to use `@kontsedal/olas-router`. Both TanStack Router and React Router v6 wire-up patterns shown; each is ~5 lines of user code (call the router's hooks, pass values into `<adapter.Bridge>`).

  Tests: +10 (4 RootOptions.scopes, 6 router adapter), total 590 passing. Typecheck clean. Biome clean (0 errors).
