## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Phase 0.2b — Router adapter package + `RootOptions.scopes` for cross-cutting scope seeding.

  Treated as patch under the 0.x.y line — purely additive across the existing nine packages, plus one new opt-in package.

  **Core — `RootOptions.scopes`**

  - New `scopes?: ReadonlyArray<[Scope<unknown>, unknown]>` option on `createRoot`. Pre-seeds scopes on the root controller instance BEFORE its factory runs so `ctx.inject(...)` resolves them from any descendant. Useful for adapters that want to publish cross-cutting values without forcing the user's root controller to call `ctx.provide(...)`. Later bindings for the same scope override earlier ones.

  **New package: `@kontsedal/olas-router`**

  A generic, router-agnostic adapter for wiring any client-side router (TanStack Router, React Router v6, or your own) into the olas controller tree via three scopes:

  - `RouteParamsScope: Scope<ReadSignal<Record<string, string>>>`
  - `RouteSearchScope: Scope<ReadSignal<Record<string, unknown>>>`
  - `RoutePathnameScope: Scope<ReadSignal<string>>`

  `createRouterAdapter()` returns `{ scopes, Bridge }`. `scopes` plugs into `createRoot({ scopes: adapter.scopes })`; `<adapter.Bridge params={...} search={...} pathname={...}>` mounts inside the React tree and pushes router state into the underlying signals on every change.

  Each `createRouterAdapter()` call mints its own signal store, so per-request SSR roots and isolated test fixtures don't share state. Shallow-equals incoming `params` / `search` records to avoid spurious writes when the router allocates fresh object literals on every render.

  **Next.js is not supported** — see `BACKLOG.md` for the philosophy reasoning.

  **Recipes**

  - `RECIPES.md` Router-integration section rewritten to use `@kontsedal/olas-router`. Both TanStack Router and React Router v6 wire-up patterns shown; each is ~5 lines of user code (call the router's hooks, pass values into `<adapter.Bridge>`).

  Tests: +10 (4 RootOptions.scopes, 6 router adapter), total 590 passing. Typecheck clean. Biome clean (0 errors).

### Patch Changes

- Phase 0.3 — Persisted mutation queue. New package `@kontsedal/olas-mutation-queue`.

  Treated as patch under the 0.x.y line — purely additive across the existing eight packages, plus one new opt-in package.

  **New package: `@kontsedal/olas-mutation-queue`**

  A `QueryClientPlugin` that persists `defineMutation({ persist: true })` runs to a `StorageAdapter` and replays pending entries on `init`. Use case: a checkout-flow `createOrder` mutation in-flight when the user reloads or the browser crashes — the queue replays it on the next page load so the user doesn't lose the request.

  - `mutationQueuePlugin({ adapter, keyPrefix, maxAttempts?, onReplayError?, onWarn? })`
  - Per-`mutationId` serial replay; different mutationIds run in parallel.
  - Bounded retries via `maxAttempts` (default 5); attempts counter persists across reloads.
  - `onReplayError` fires when an entry exhausts retries OR references an unregistered `mutationId` (typical when the module hasn't been imported yet — the entry stays in storage until the module loads).
  - Idempotency is the consumer's responsibility — include a stable `idempotencyKey` in variables, have the server dedupe.

  **Core**

  - `defineMutation({ mutationId, mutate, ... })` — module-scope registration so the queue plugin can find the handler on replay, BEFORE any controller exists. Returns the spec unchanged (with a `__olas: 'mutation'` brand); pass it to `ctx.mutation(...)` with optional spread of per-controller hooks like `onSuccess`.
  - `MutationSpec` gains `mutationId?: string` and `persist?: boolean`. `ctx.mutation` validates that `persist: true` requires a non-empty `mutationId`.
  - `QueryClientPlugin` gains `onMutationEnqueue` / `onMutationSettle` hooks. `MutationEnqueueEvent` / `MutationSettleEvent` exported.
  - `lookupRegisteredMutation` exported alongside `lookupRegisteredQuery` for plugin lookups.
  - `MutationLifecycleHooks` internal type wired in `createMutation` — only emits when `spec.persist === true`.

  **Persist**

  - `StorageAdapter` gains optional `keys(): Iterable<string> | Promise<Iterable<string>>` so consumers (like the mutation queue) can enumerate pending entries. Both `localStorageAdapter` and `indexedDbAdapter` implement it.

  **Recipes**

  - `RECIPES.md` gains a "Persisted mutations" section with the canonical pattern: module-level `defineMutation`, root-level `mutationQueuePlugin`, controller-level `ctx.mutation` with spread, and the idempotency-key convention.

  Tests: +11 (queue plugin coverage), total 580 passing. Typecheck clean. Biome clean (0 errors).
