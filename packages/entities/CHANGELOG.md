## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Phase 0.1 — Standard Schema adapter, form.submit lifecycle, structural sharing on refetch, and select projection.

  Treating as patch under the 0.x.y line — the changes are additive and don't break any pinned behavior.

  **Standard Schema**

  - New `validator(schema)` in `@kontsedal/olas-core` accepts any
    `StandardSchemaV1`-compatible schema (Zod 4, Valibot 1, ArkType 2, …).
    Sync vs async is handled transparently — the wrapper returns a Promise
    only when the underlying schema does.
  - `StandardSchemaV1` type is re-exported for consumers who want the type
    without taking a dep on `@standard-schema/spec`.
  - `zodValidator` in `@kontsedal/olas-zod` is now a thin alias over
    `validator(...)` — Zod 4 implements Standard Schema, so the Zod-specific
    path is now indirected through the cross-library one.

  **Forms**

  - `form.submit(handler, options?)` — first-class submission lifecycle.
    Returns `{ ok, data?, error? }`. Pre-validates (skippable), marks every
    field touched on invalid, captures handler throws to `submitError` and
    refuses parallel submits.
  - `form.isSubmitting` / `form.submitCount` / `form.submitError` signals.
  - `field.setErrors(string[])` — pin externally-sourced errors (typically
    from a failed submit). These live in a separate `serverErrors` channel,
    survive validator re-runs, and auto-clear on the next user write to the
    field.
  - `form.setErrors({ 'user.email': [...], 'tags.1': [...] })` — same
    channel as `field.setErrors`, routed by dot-separated path through
    nested forms and field arrays (numeric segments are array indices).
  - `field.reset()` and `form.reset()` clear the server-errors channel too.

  **Queries**

  - Structural sharing on refetch: `Entry.applySuccess` walks the previous
    data and the new payload, returning the previous reference wherever a
    sub-tree is deep-equal. Unchanged refetches now produce `===` results,
    so downstream `computed`s and React snapshots stop thrashing. Bails on
    `Map` / `Set` / `Date` / `RegExp` / class instances. Cycle-guarded with
    a `WeakSet`. Also wired into `InfiniteEntry.startFetch` so the head
    page's identity survives a no-op refresh.
  - New `select` overload on `ctx.use(query, { key, select: (data) => U })`.
    Projects the underlying `T` to a view `U` via a per-subscription
    `computed`. Combined with structural sharing, a stable `select` over an
    unchanged payload outputs the same reference — downstream consumers
    dedupe via `Object.is` and don't re-render. `refetch()` and
    `firstValue()` project through `select` too.

  Tests: +50, total 563 passing.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Round of correctness fixes from a multi-agent code review.

  **Core**

  - `isAbortError`: now matches any object whose `name === 'AbortError'`, not just
    `DOMException`. axios / msw / custom plain Errors that signal abort no longer
    trip retry loops.
  - `createEmitter`: emit-time handler throws are isolated — one throwing handler
    no longer blocks subsequent handlers (spec §20.6). `createEmitter({ onError })`
    accepts a reporter; `ctx.emitter()` wires it to the root's `onError` with
    `kind: 'emitter'`.
  - `readOnly()`: returned object is now `Object.freeze`d so `(ro as any).value = …`
    throws in strict mode rather than silently mutating.
  - `debounced` / `throttled`: both accept an optional `{ signal: AbortSignal }`
    so the internal effect, pending timer, and `source` subscription can be torn
    down. Without it the helpers retain the source for the program's lifetime —
    pass a signal whenever the source outlives the consumer.
  - `ctx.lazyChild`: explicit `lazyChild.dispose()` now also splices the internal
    parent-dispose flag entry. Prior code left one closure on the parent's
    lifecycle list per ever-disposed lazyChild — slow leak in apps that repeatedly
    open and close code-split children.
  - `Form.set({ tags: [...] })`: array-shaped patches now preserve item identity
    on overlapping indices instead of `clear() + add()`-ing every position.
    Touched / dirty / in-flight validators on existing items survive the patch.
    `resetWithInitial` also re-anchors `initialItems` on the underlying
    `FieldArray` so a later `reset()` returns to the most-recently-applied initial.

  **Entities**

  - `entities.update()` on an id that isn't in the store no longer allocates an
    empty slot via `getSlot`. Under `maxSlots`, the orphan allocation could
    LRU-touch a never-seen id ahead of real entities and trigger spurious
    eviction. The no-op path is now truly side-effect-free.

  **Cross-tab**

  - The internal `seenByPeer` Map is now bounded (cap 64) with LRU-style
    eviction. A long-lived tab seeing many short-lived peers no longer grows
    this Map without bound, and `dispose()` clears it.

  **Devtools**

  - `TreeView` rules-of-hooks bug: `useMemo` was called after an early-return
    on empty trees, so the hook order changed across renders. Now computed
    unconditionally.

## 0.0.1-rc.1

Initial release. Entity-normalization plugin.

- `defineEntity({ name, idOf })` — declare an entity type with an id extractor.
- `entitiesPlugin([Post, User, ...])` — installs as `QueryClientPlugin`. Observes
  every `SetDataEvent` (fetch / set / remote) and walks query data to populate an
  internal normalized store plus a reverse index of (entity-id → queries holding it).
- `entities.signal(Post, id)` — `ReadSignal<Post | undefined>` for per-entity
  subscriptions. Components consume via `use(...)` from `@kontsedal/olas-react`.
- `entities.upsert(Post, raw)` — explicit branding (for events / non-query sources).
- `entities.update(Post, id, patchOrUpdater)` — accepts `Partial<T>` (shallow merge)
  OR `(prev: T) => T` (updater function). Patches every query holding the id via
  `QueryClientPluginApi.setEntryData`. Batched into one notification round.
  Warns in dev when the entity isn't in the store.
- `entities.get(Post, id)` / `entities.invalidate(Post, id)` — non-reactive read /
  store removal.
- `entities.entries(Post)` / `entities.bindings(Post, id)` — devtools snapshots of
  the normalized store and the reverse index.

Notable behaviors:

- Walker uses stack-based cycle detection (`WeakSet` of currently-descending nodes),
  so shared-reference DAGs walk both paths but true cycles still terminate.
- Path accumulator is mutable across the walk; clones happen only at binding
  boundaries (push/pop on descent/ascent).
- `bindingKey` uses the core `stableHash` (now re-exported) so Date / undefined /
  key-ordering match the QueryClient's own entry hash.
- All public methods throw when called with an `EntityDef` that wasn't passed to
  `entitiesPlugin([...])`.
- Dev builds emit a one-shot warning when a single entity partition crosses 10k
  unique ids in the slot map.
